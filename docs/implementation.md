# Implementation and validation

The reconstruction follows the January 1998 Windows software engine using data shared by the September 1998 and October 2000 European discs. It reads the original resource formats directly. There is no CPU emulator, translated executable or dependency on the analysis workspace in the game.

The sibling analysis project supplies original-code reference runs and independent numerical tests. C++ comparisons are added as each subsystem is implemented. Passing original-against-original repeatability tests is not counted as C++ acceptance.

Current implementation:

- Bounded binary readers and case-insensitive resource lookup.
- Packed and planar IFF images with ByteRun1 compression and indexed palettes.
- Terrain heights and scenery placements.
- Preference parsing, conversion and serialization.

Next: the window/input shell, renderer and model programs; then simulation, avionics, frontend/campaign integration and audio. Full journey tests and CI follow once the game is connected.

Original uninitialized memory and out-of-bounds effects are excluded. Invalid resources and unsafe states receive bounded handling. No game media or generated screenshots are committed.
